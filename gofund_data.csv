Last Monday, Liam went for a routine tonsillitis surgery. After the surgery he came home and did not seem to be healing. Wednesday night into Thursday morning, he threw up two liters of blood at home. Thursday morning he was rushed back Children’s where doctors discovered the source of the bleed: a post tonsillectomy hemorrhage in his right carotid artery.  In layman’s terms, his carotid artery— the main artery to the brain— was leaking since his surgery, causing him to slowly bleed out. 
 
During his second surgery, he needed nine units of blood plus additives and during surgery went into cardiac arrest. He coded on the operating table for 10 minutes before doctors were able to revive him. Afterwards, he was intubated for his own safety. 

 Initial results indicate he does not have brain damage, but there are immediate health issues that will take months to heal. More details will be known as the weeks go by. He is currently intubated and sedated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children’s Hospital.

 Doctors anticipate he will remain in this state at least for a few weeks before slowly weaning him off the ventilator. Recovery afterwards will last months as doctors learn what kind of physical and mental issues he may have.

 Dan and Ashleigh have been at the hospital every day and little sister Willa is being taken care of by family and friends. Liam is currently not accepting visitors. 

 The financial burden of Liam’s hospital and recovery bills will be tremendous after months of intensive care. Your donation will help the family pay for medical bills.

In my more than 35 years of training residents, I have met so many incredible people. But there are very few like Erica. She is in a class of her own. She is such a kind caring person who loves children, anything purple, Disney, super heroes, and of course her husband Marc. Erica left NYC to go on to do a radiology residency in Colorado with the hopes of ultimately becoming a pediatric neuro radiologist. Six months into training she developed severe abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with stage 4b uterine cancer. This devastating diagnosis crippled Erica and her husband Marc. Over the past 15 months Erica has been through numerous surgeries, chemo course and clinical trials. They have travelled across the country and recently from Colorado to Arlington Texas which is where they are now. Erica has been fierce in trying to combat this dreaded illness. Her husband Marc Hedge has been her rock through all of this and been by her side for the past 13 years. For the past 8 years Marc has done everything possible to help Erica become a doctor. He has been Erica's financial supporter, emotional supporter and beloved partner, helping her to go to medical school and residency. Most recently over these past 15 months Marc has lost his job, has used up all of his retirement funds and savings, and lost their home as they sought care for Erica's cancer. He has done everything to help her to fulfill her dream of becoming a pediatric neuro radiologist, to help children with devastating illnesses and to be a foster mom for children in need. Marc and Erica, the dynamic duo have been through so much. And they keep trying, but they have not gotten good news. I am asking for help for both Erica who had such great aspirations to help children and now her life is being cut so short, as well as Marc who has spent every moment and every penny to be by her side, to be her protector, care giver, cheer leader and dream maker.

Additionally his red blood cell counts were low and his platelets were registering over 1,200,000, nearly 3 times higher than the highest they ever should be. The proceeding hours blurred into days filled with tears, a hospitalized child and seemingly endless medical procedures that culminated with a diagnosis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. As a mother I was crushed, but I knew I had to learn as much about his diagnosis as possible to provide him with the best opportunities at living a long, full life. As I have come to know, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia or CML is a very rare cancer of the blood and bone marrow affecting about 1 in 100,000 people per year with the average age of diagnosis being 65 years old. Of that number only 2% of all cases are diagnosed in children under 18 years old. Due to the rarity of CML and the marginal pediatric occurrence, research and published data is limited. At present time only 4 medications have been approved for the treatment of CML in children, all gaining approval in the last 20 years. Little is known about the long term effects of these medications on children yet with CML being incurable, their daily use is the best and sometimes only chance diagnosed children have at survival. While all of this information came with the necessity for unforeseen adjustments, we remain hopeful and committed to creating rainbows in the storm. I’m sure every parent is familiar with the phrase “it takes a village” and the accuracy of that adage has never been as clear until now. In an effort to provide Reef with every opportunity available for managing his care and maximizing his health and comfort, I have created this go fund me as a part of his Caring Bridge profile. Currently, the anticipated costs and plan for treatment are uncertain but do include a trip to see one of the few pediatric CML specialists worldwide. While planning this visit is only a starting point, the choice was made to provide Reef access to a clinical trial of a medication that otherwise would not be available for his age group. The goal on this page is reflective of the costs of that travel and consult for our developing plan. We will use his Caring Bridge profile to post periodic updates of his journey where family, friends and the organizations interested in supporting him can contribute or simply follow along. Please know these are uncertain times and while we are grateful for any generosity you are able to contribute, the only requirement to participate in Reefs fight against CML is love ❤️",medical-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,98,2025-04-11 10:31:13

Due to the severe brain injury, Henry also developed a seizure disorder.

For the first couple of years of his life, Henry's seizures were able to be controlled with minimal medicine. As he got older, his seizures increased, and the need for more intensive medicines was required. For years, they have tried multiple different medicines, weighing out the pros and cons of their effectiveness combined with the severity of the side effects. As Henry has continued to get older, his seizures have increased in intensity and frequency.

In January 2025, at age 31, I was diagnosed with Stage 3b Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, a type of breast cancer that’s elusive, sneaky, and stubborn. It’s hormone-receptor positive, which means it feeds off estrogen and progesterone. It’s HER2 negative, which means we need lots of angles of attack, given it’s likely not going to respond to any one thing exclusively. It’s Grade 1, but before discovery it had already spread to at least 3-5 lymph nodes and measured 9.5 cm (softball-sized). Hence the Stage 3b label.",medical-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,85,2025-04-11 10:33:24

This exam was physically challenging and his legs gave out two thirds into the practice run. Two nights later would be a very restless night. Jordan’s leg was in a lot of pain so I decided to take him into the emergency room.
They diagnosed him with extreme Rhabdomyolysis, meaning his muscles were breaking down and rapidly, he had a 48,000 CK count. They treated him with IV fluids to prevent kidney damage and put him into the ICU. With these fluids there is a risk for compartment syndrome, his thigh muscle was constricting and there was too much pressure in his thigh, allowing further damage to his leg. They will be operating on his leg to release the muscle and save his leg. 
Unfortunately, just last week Jordan no longer was receiving health insurance. The thought of being out of work for a long time and dealing with the rest of school is a stress that can overtake someone’s mind. We’re asking for anything that would help this financial burden during this difficult time and healing process.",medical-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,85,2025-04-11 10:33:28

My dad was a hard worker with relentless ambition. Once he set his mind to something, it was going to happen. He landed a job straight out of law school and quickly became one of the best plaintiff attorneys in the area. After only 12 to 13 years practicing as an attorney, he decided to venture out on his own and founded a new law office with his partner. It took immense courage to do this without any guaranteed income or safety net and 4 children to raise on his own, including 2 in college. His unwavering confidence drove him to succeed, with the practice thriving for the past 3 years. The culture at his firm was incredible. He was the heart of the firm, balancing a professional demeanor with a silly side that made the workplace unique. He secured many big verdicts and built a reputation as someone hundreds of clients could turn to for guidance. He was always respected and known for his unwavering dedication and valuable advice. He put himself through law school while raising two kids and working two jobs. He was at the top of his class. From the time he was able to work, he always had a job.

No smoke alarms were triggered, but thanks to the quick action of her neighbor, Ashley and Hank made it safely out of their unit.

This is so devastating, not only for the sheer horror of losing every personal belonging, but also compounded by the fact that this is the second time Ashley has needed to “start over” at a new residence in the past three years.

I have to plant myself in more progressive states that are unfortunately way more expensive (easily over $1k a month for a single bedroom in a shared space or around $2k a month for a fucking small space to myself, unless I get extra lucky).

April 5th started like any other Saturday. Abbey was making breakfast/muffins for the kids when the smoke detectors went off. Abbey initially thought she may have over-cooked the muffins, but quickly realized there was a massive fire in the garage. Abbey and Tom sprung into action- moving the family to the back yard (everyone still in PJ's- no shoes or coats) and called 911. Tom had home fire-extinguishers on the ready, but they didn't make a dent in the massive fire. My sister and Tom stood in their back yard in horror watching the fire get larger and larger. The fire department was delayed due to dealing with a carbon monoxide emergency on the other side of town (resulting in several first responders being hospitalized). When the fire department arrived, there were no less than 20 emergency vehicles and more first responders than we could count. Abbey and the kids went to a neighbor's house where they were out-of-sight of the chaos, while Tom absorbed all of the information from the first responders.

***************
From Jeff: For the past year or so, I have lived in my dream cottage by the Kentucky River near Tates Creek south of Lexington, Kentucky. This past weekend, an extraordinary and relentless series of rains filled the river and its tributaries beyond bursting, resulting in the worst flooding yet recorded along the river’s course. I evacuated my cats, a few precious things, and a suitcase of clothes on the morning of April 4, when it became apparent that I might not be able to drive away later. By April 5, the house was inaccessible except by boat, and by April 6, it was filled with four feet or so of standing water. Virtually everything that I was unable to take with me has been destroyed or must be discarded. I now face serious unanticipated expenses, including the costs of wardrobe, furniture, and appliance replacement, as well as the costs associated with living as a climate refugee in a hotel and dining on restaurant takeout. Any amount of donation to defray these expenses will be gratefully received.",emergencies-fundraiser,Created 3 d ago,64,2025-04-11 10:51:12

Odyssey of the Mind is an international educational program that provides creative problem-solving opportunities for students from kindergarten through college.

Students have learned to cooperate and respect the ideas of others, to evaluate and make judicious decisions on their own. Our students have gained a lot of self-confidence and increased self-esteem through their hard work. In addition, they work within a budget, so they have learned to manage their finances. Most importantly, they see that there is often more than one way to solve a problem and that sometimes the process is more important than the end result.

Hey y’all,
My name is Bryli Lee Jameson, and I’m a rising third-year dance major at the University of Texas at Austin. Though I began my dance journey just a few years ago, with the unwavering support of mentors, professors, and my family, I’ve grown tremendously — both technically and artistically.
This summer, I’ve been honored with the opportunity to train at the renowned Bates Dance Festival in Lewiston, Maine — a program that brings together artists from across the globe and pushes dancers to reach new creative heights. Attending would be a major step in my development as a performer, choreographer, and future leader in the arts.
To make this dream possible, I’m seeking support to help cover tuition, room & board, and transportation costs. Any amount you’re able to contribute would bring me one step closer to this life-changing experience. Thank you for believing in me and in the power of dance!
With love,

This summer, I was accepted into the Interharmony Music Festival, which is an orchestra and chamber festival in Acqui Terme, Italy. I am super excited that I get the opportunity to go, but unfortunately, I cannot afford the festival alone. I have applied to grants through my university and through my music program, but unfortunately, that only covers about half of the tuition and I am not guaranteed to receive them. In total, the tuition is $3,794. This includes two lessons per week, two chamber coachings per week, lectures, seminars, master classes, orchestra, room/board in double or triple room capacity with 3 meals per day, excursions provided by the festival, and a complimentary shuttle to/from Milan Malpensa Airport to/from Acqui Terme. The flights are about $1,100 as well, and so unfortunately, it is too expensive for my family to afford alone. This opportunity would be amazing for my growth as a musician because I would get weekly lessons with a super cool and really amazing horn player, Joy Hodges. I would get lots of chances to perform solo works and orchestral works in a more professional setting. I would also be in a fully immersed musical environment in beautiful Italy.

We had just opened our Sandy location after spending two years and considerable resources, only to have to close it 6 months later, along with our main money maker, the 9th & 9th location. Our attempt to reopen Sandy was costly and unsuccessful. We decided to cut our losses and sell the building at a significant loss. Grasping for straws, we went for a couple of SBA loans made available for businesses. Some were forgivable, but most were not. We started with 3 restaurants and 350 seats and exited the pandemic with one small location with under 28 seats. Our remaining location, while financially healthy on its own, is now shouldering the burden for all remaining debt incurred for all 3 locations. This is an impossible situation that will continue to doom us to financial failure, leading to the closure of Mazza if we don’t do something drastic. We spent all of 2024 pursuing negotiations with the SBA to reach a workable solution to no avail.

If you’re able to donate anything at all, even just a few dollars, it would mean more than words can say. If you’re not able to donate, please consider sharing this with others. Every little bit helps and brings us one step closer to giving Chad the chance to keep living her happy, loving life. :) Thank you for reading and for caring about my sweet boy . I will post updates about his condition as well. Previous story I adopted my kitten (Chad) in January of 2025 . If you can see in some of the photos he has a left eye that closes a little over half way. We called it a pirate eye, unfortunately the vets say it is more and he will need to have his whole eye removed if they don’t do surgery. At this time I cannot afford to pay for his surgery on my own. So I have created this go fund me on behalf of my kitten to reach out to see if anyone would be able to help. I am a full time college student right now and there is no pet insurance that will fully cover the amount of his eye surgery. So please share this even if you can’t help or help what you can I will take anything at this point I just don’t want him to have a missing eye:( He is the sweetest kitten, he loved to play and absolutely loves when I open the back sliding door so he can see and hear all the birds out side.

They are both 9 yr old Shetland Sheepdogs & always go in together (safety in pairs). So, we go in thinking everything is normal. Leaving with medication for a possible infection-just run of the mill stuff. She had full blood work done that day as well. Coming near the end of those medications we'd seen only minor if any improvement, so we were going to go back soon when full course of medications was done. But, instead we had a scare when we found early one morning she had blood coming from her nose at some point during the night because there was blood on the sheets of the big bed where she of course sleeps. We immediately got her to the vet. Our vet did skull x-rays looking for the cause, possibly an object lodged preventing breathing & causing inflammation, etc. When they could not find the cause we were referred to a specialist. We were extremely lucky because the next day the Internist had an opening due to a cancellation, so they could see her. We went scared, worried & her very distressed, breathing heavily from her mouth but taking some medication to assist. We were told she needed a CT scan & a Rhinoscopy (camera scope) to look & see what was happening. The next days were a whirlwind of googling for additional information and tears. Sophie has always been healthy & now they are doing a biopsy, telling us there is a mass at the back of her nose. It's pressing on the back of her right eye & blocking breathing.

This is a rare type of cancer that cats can get from a vaccine. As first-time pet parents in the US, we naively did not have pet insurance. So far, we have paid $1,500 for surgery to remove the tumor and another $1,500 for a CT scan to see how much cancer is remaining. Luckily, the cancer had not spread too much. She only has microscopic disease now. However, without further treatment to remove the microscopic disease, injection site sarcoma is more likely to reoccur.

After talking with the oncologist at Bay State Veterinary Emergency, the best option to give her a long life and prevent the cancer from coming back is to do radiation. In her case, the doctor recommends doing 16-18 days of curative radiation. This is not cheap. The estimate we received is between $10,000 and $13,000. Between Cayte’s work bonus, our tax refund, and selling some things, we have managed to round up around $6,000.

So that night, on January 19th, I took him in for an ER vet visit where at the time they determined there was indeed blood in his urine but could only make speculations on the cause. So we decided to try a few options: antibiotics for infections, changed his food to a prescription for crystals. When he went back for a urine analysis and culture, it was determined he still had an infection and it was E. coli. So they gave him a longer/stronger dose of the same antibiotics. This would become the trend up until a few weeks ago. Tobi went through four cycles of antibiotics (I'll list below) and FINALLY after the fourth cycle it seemed the infection was gone, but just a few days later I noticed a very strong and concerning smell in his urine.

2 months ago our baby, Cheese, stopped eating and was very obviously sick, we took her to the ER vet, they charged us $700, said it was just gas and sent us home with metronidazole. She got worse the next few days, the metronidazole trashed her wbc and platelets, brought her back to the ER and they did tests, told us it was likely autoimmune or cancer, sent us home with some antibiotics, steroids, and anti nausea meds and a $1200 bill. Once cheese was off the metronidazole and on the steroids, she drastically improved and was back to her normal self. We had to go to our normal vet weekly then biweekly for follow up blood tests to monitor her, but never got a diagnoses for the last 2 months, each vet visit cost $200-$400. Wednesday cheese started throwing up again and avoiding food, we got more antinausea meds, but she still was hardly eating or drinking, so we rushed to the ER vet again this morning (Saturday 4/5), and got blood work, X-rays, and ultrasounds. Her calcium is high and she has some damage to her liver (potentially from the steroids), kidneys, and there were calcium deposits. They found some lumps/masses in the scans, but with where they were located, they were unable to get biopsies. This visit cost $1800. The next recommended steps were to admit her to a different ER in Bannockburn for the weekend to monitor her and keep her on fluids and then to be seen by an internalist Monday to run more tests and specialty scans to determine if it is cancer, however the ballpark price range for just the ER stay was $3,000-$6,000, and that doesn't include the tests or treatments needed, which we cannot afford, so we brought her home, and will need to admit her on Monday, as the internalist is booked months out, and the ER is the fastest way to get her seen.

Our family has been hit hard with vet expenses for our 12 year old dog Tiga. A month or so ago she ate the polystyrene beads out of a neck pillow that had been left out on the bed and its all been downhill since then. Tiga had surgery to remove a blockage caused by the beads. During that surgery the vet noticed a suspicious spot on her intestines and biopsied a lymph node. It came back positive for mast cell cancer. Based on where the cancer cells were found the vet couldn't really give us any information on what her prognosis was. We were devestated and decided to take her to an oncologist to get some answers. We had no plans on doing anything besides medical management and diet changes but we wanted to make sure we had all the info necessary to make the best choices for Tiga.",animals-fundraiser,Created 2 d ago,35,2025-04-11 11:10:53

Julie and Eric adopted Charlie Parker from a kill shelter back in 2021. Up until more recently, he has been a healthy pup who loves walks, loves to eat, and served as our community’s resident anxious pup that is actually full of love. A few months ago, he started to show signs of imbalance. They started to worry when they noticed it worsen week after week. They took him in to see his vet. That vet sent them to a neurologist, and that neurologist sent them to an oncologist. After an MRI and a CT scan, it was determined that he had brain cancer in an inoperable spot. He now needs radiation to shrink the tumor to hopefully live 1.5-2 more years. It’s not a cure, but it will give him some relief and give him a couple more good years with us.

Julie and Eric have always been so generous in extending their table. When Charlie was first adopted, he was so scared to meet us but then quickly became a core part of our community. Let’s come together and support them as they care for Charlie.",animals-fundraiser,Created 6 d ago,60,2025-04-11 11:13:02

I have the time to spend a few days a week cleaning up garbage and taking it to the landfill; I just need some help to do so. The more I can raise, the more I can clean and get others involved in the project. I will be documenting the process with videos showing progress and updates on how much trash has been removed. I am starting with a goal of 10,000 lbs. Every load taken to the landfill is weighed, and a receipt is given. Each one will be added to the number until we reach our goal. I will not be adding any personal garbage to this; it will be 100% waste from public lands. Once the first goal is met, I will reevaluate and create another goal. We have millions of acres that are free for our use; let's all pitch in and take care of it. This will also help in the purchase of things like rakes, shovels, bags, etc.",environment-fundraiser,Created 5 d ago,9,2025-04-11 11:15:10

This will be the second year of this initiative, a necessary next step to help evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of using goats to control knotweed.

Goats Grazing Knotweed is a management technique first implemented in 2024. Goats were grazed on about 10 acres of riverside land in 3 separate parcels from mid June into early Oct. The goats did an effective job of knocking back the knotweed by eating the knotweed leaves. In fact, knotweed made up more than 50% of the goats’ diet. This effectively weakens the knotweed plant, knocking back it's ability to regenerate. In most cases the goats were rotated on the different parcels 3 times during the grazing periods. The results were similar to the effects of manually cutting the knotweed 3 times in a growing season.",environment-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,2,2025-04-11 11:23:36

Real Slab Masterz was started as an idea to relieve many from the duties of barbecuing for family events and ultimately freeing up their time. When we first started, we attempted to purchase a food truck but due to the cost of the truck and lack of smokers we could not go that route. In order to comply with Health Department Regulations, which requires a three-compartment sink, hand-washing sink and running hot water. We needed to find a trailer that fulfilled those requirements. Johnson County and Hamilton County stated they would issue a yearly permit for the trailer. Marion County, which is the county for the City of Indianapolis stated they would not issue a permit due to the trailer not being completely enclosed on all sides, not having our smoker attached to the unit, and not having a serving window. However, we are allowed to operate at MULTIPLE events in Indianapolis on a temporary daily basis at the cost of $ 55.00 per event for the permit. Last year our permit cost in Marion County was well above $300.00. Therefore, we have been going to the county above Indianapolis and below Indianapolis. The Town of Sheridan, Indiana and Franklin, Indiana has been very supportive and has sustained us to this point with a select few from Indianapolis continuing to support us. With that being said we would like to purchase an enclosed trailer that will allow us to work in any county we chose. We were recently informed the rules regarding our set-up will be changing. These new changes will hinder our operation and set us back to the point where it will be hard to operate. Currently we are weather dependent and rely heavily on the elements to operate. From 10 degrees to 99 degrees, rain and snow, we are outside in the weather. Obtaining a trailer would allow us the freedom to operate in counties such as Marion and Hendricks Counties along with multiple other counties in Indiana. We recently applied for a trailer which cost $ 50,000 and was denied. It is sad to say but I expected that outcome. The power of human cooperation is greater than any banking institution. The money will be sent directly to the company for the purchase of the trailer, and everything will be out in the open. Once $ 50,000 is obtained the GoFundMe will be discontinued. We are humbly asking you and your loved ones to please help us in the form of $ 5.00.",business-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,88,2025-04-11 11:24:33

The Swim Learn Play method includes incorporating water safety skills and sensory regulation (swim), building speech and language skills (learn), and utilizing children's strengths through playing (play)!

Community is another pillar within the Swim Learn Play mission in that all of our therapy sessions take place within a community pool. However, many times, our current community is not adapted to what our neurodiverse swimmers need. The goals for attaining a swimming pool platform are endless. Having a platform in the pool allows even our littlest swimmers more independence navigating the water. It also allows sensory input to the feet (grounding) and additional gross motor movement for our swimmers to stand, climb, jump, and dive within the safety of the water. The platform also allows us to adapt the community pool even in the smallest way to have our swimmers feel more welcomed. We want our swimmers to have the ability to live more independent and safer lives, and this equipment is our step in the right direction! Any donation, big or small, is greatly appreciated.

Our center is a STAR 4 quality childcare center in Pennsylvania. We have a phenomenal staff who take great care of the children who attend our center. We have recently moved into our new location and we are super excited about that! In our journey to move locations, we have had many obstacles along the way. We started off by getting loans for a mortgage and renovations. After procuring these loans, we found out that we would need to come up with additional funds to drill a brand new well on the property. PA DEP regulations have made this transition into our new center a long, drawn-out, and expensive battle. My husband and I have done as much of the renovations as we could ourselves while also paying a contractor for the major areas. We had to spend $20,000 for the installation of the new well that was up to DEP Regulations. We also had to spend an additional $10,000 for a water treatment system that was also up to DEP regulations. The regulations have required us to install a system that is much bigger than what we thought we would need, and more than what is recommended by water softener/ filtration manufacturers. We also had to install a handicap-accessible bathroom that cost an additional $10,000. For a small business, this has all added up. We are asking for any help to offset the costs that the business has endured this past year. And yes, we purchased the new building back in May of 2024 with plans to be moved into the new building by August; we just moved in last week. This has taken its toll as we were paying for the new building, while continuing to pay rent at the old location. It has been my dream to provide a great learning environment for small children.

Her time and involvement in our community is priceless, however, she has been limited in her ability to personally advocate at these meetings due to mechanical difficulties she is facing with her motorized wheelchair.

While Audit LA is currently waiting for her insurance to approve and repair her wheelchair, there is another avenue in which she can affectively attend her meetings.

We are initiating a recall for Mayor Bertaut, Vice Mayor Nett, Councilwoman Luke, and Councilwoman Khalil. These four have committed FOIA violations, shown incompetence, misuse of office, and neglect of duty. They have shown cronyism by hiring their political ally as Interim Town Manager without interviewing any other candidates or including other town council members. They then decreased the required qualifications for the permanent Town Manager position so their political ally would actually qualify for the position. They have done town business in emails and on systems that prevent public awareness, skirting FOIA requirements. They act like the middle school popular clique by appointing themselves to preferred Town committee liaison positions with less experience in the committee's focus area than other town council members. They have allowed VM Nett to vote on issues that he should have been recused from due to conflict of interest. They continue to support VM Nett even though he has been found to be untrustworthy by the Commonwealth's Attorney. They promised to lower utility bills by subsidizing water/sewer by moving $1.6M from general funds but haven't answered how they are going to make up this money in the general fund. They were voted in by a small majority of town voters and promised to work for the whole town, but that vote tally represents only a third of the registered voters of Purcellville. Rather than working with the whole Town Council and our Town Staff for the benefit of all our residents, the nearly 9,000 that make up the Council's constituency, they have rammed through the positions of a minority of our residents.

Background: PTOs typically supplement gaps in school funding, supporting enrichment opportunities (field trips, guest speakers, materials, etc.), purchasing materials and supplies, and sponsoring community events. However, because of wealth and resource inequities among public schools in our community, not all PTOs can raise equal amounts of money. In AAPS elementary and K-8 schools, per-student PTO income ranges from $40 per student per year to $238. For the past several years, the PTO Council has worked with school reps, caretakers, teachers, and the district to identify these gaps and create steps for improvements. In the past, recipient schools have used their $20 for $30k funds to meet a range of school needs, including providing teacher grants and enrichment opportunities.",community-fundraiser,"Created February 26th, 2025",257,2025-04-11 11:37:26

Running wasn’t always something I loved. It found me when I decided to start taking better care of myself, especially with my family’s history of heart disease. What began as a way to stay healthy quickly grew into something much deeper — running became my therapy, my discipline, and a powerful reminder that I’m capable of more than I ever imagined. In 2023, I was training for the Chicago Marathon. I gave it everything — heart, focus, and dedication — but an injury kept me from crossing that finish line. It broke a part of me— but it also lit a fire. That day, I made a promise to myself: this isn’t the end. There’s more in me. That’s when I set my sights on Boston — not just any marathon, but this one. A race that means resilience, heart, sacrifice and home. To help make this dream a reality, I’m raising $1,000 for Live Fit Army (LFA) — a community that has been such a meaningful part of my journey, both physically and emotionally. LFA is so much more than a running group — it’s a space where we learn to show up, for ourselves and for each other, even on the hard days. It’s about growing together, celebrating the little victories, and reminding one another that we’re stronger than we think. LFA believed in me during moments when I struggled to believe in myself. They’ve lifted me up, cheered me on, and helped me keep going. Now, I want to give back — so that others can find the same sense of connection, strength, and hope. Your support — whether it’s a small donation or simply a few kind words — helps more than you know. You’re not just helping me get to the Boston Marathon. You’re helping someone else find the courage to start their own journey — towards health, healing, and believing in what’s possible.

Like any other Simi Valley residents looking to get their weenies working, the boys decide to summon a demon who “specializes in turning boys into men” per her website.

Although on the surface a slap stick comedy, Simi Valley Threesome aims to entertain it's audience by making fun of the societal concept of masculinity, or what we think it is. It pokes fun at the idea that virginity is lame and shares that real masculinity is being proud of the person you are inside.",creative-fundraiser,"Created March 26th, 2025",24,2025-04-11 11:54:25

Vacuum Girl is a live presentation of a television pilot written and performed by Erica Bitton. It follows Jane, a 30’s ish woman, living through consistent, surreal dissociations in New York.

Erica serves as both narrator and performer, delivering every line spoken by each role while operating from behind a booth equipped with LED lights and a mixing board. This fast-paced, meticulously timed performance invites the audience into a fresh, immersive experience where she masterfully controls the unfolding story, blending dialogue and stage directions into a seamless whole.",creative-fundraiser,"Created March 17th, 2025",42,2025-04-11 11:54:41

Devoted to remembering who I truly am and what I am capable of offering this world. Dance has been my life’s anchor through challenges, growth, and transformation. For years, it has helped me move through grief, release past trauma, and step into my power. I have now arrived at a turning point on my journey — one that feels deeply aligned with my purpose as a healer and artist.

A few months ago I made the decision to listen to the call of my heart and got a one way ticket to Peru. There was a strong pull I felt that I didn’t understand until I arrived.

I started voice lessons at 5, guitar at 12, and I’ve been performing since I was very young. What a lot of you probably don’t know, is that I have also been writing songs since that time, and I would estimate that I have written thousands of songs at this point in my life. Most of them found their way to the trash can (especially in my younger days) but a lot have been saved in the archives of old phones, external hard drives, USBs and more. My dream has always been to write, record and perform my own songs. Even though I am now happily working in music every day, (playing cover gigs and teaching lessons) I am really eager to take the next step in my career by recording my original songs - but it’s still not quite in the budget. Professional studio time can cost thousands of dollars per day and many people don’t know that the entire recording process is very time-consuming and extremely expensive, especially with the right set-up. I’ve given it a lot of thought and would like to ask you guys for some help in funding my first album - all songs from the archives. Some of you have heard these songs live and others will be songs I’ve never played publicly. If you’ve ever enjoyed my music at a restaurant, bar, or event, and would like to contribute to my career, or you just want to support me on this journey, now is the time. Any donation you can make will help me tremendously and I would be so, so eternally grateful for your support on this project that means so much to me.

An innocuous prompt to be sure, but something stirred within me that day. From scratch, I drafted a story about a fictional superhero that would save the day and make everyone happy by removing the cloud and bringing back the sun for all to enjoy. It was during those brief 10 minutes that I realized the power of storytelling, and it was from then on I became addicted to the writing process and the joy it brought to me and those around me.

Here is a short explanation of what it is like to be a caregiver to a loved one:

""The plight of spouses who become caregivers to their disabled husbands or wives is often an emotionally and physically challenging journey. These dedicated individuals find themselves navigating a complex role where they must balance their responsibilities as a partner and a caregiver. Constantly providing care, managing medical needs, and dealing with the emotional toll can lead to feelings of isolation, burnout, and stress. Despite the difficulties they face, these spouses often show remarkable resilience, unwavering love, and selflessness in their commitment to supporting their disabled partners, making them unsung heroes in the realm of caregiving. The need for societal support, respite care, and understanding cannot be overstated to alleviate the burden placed on these caregivers.""",creative-fundraiser,"Created April 2nd, 2025",13,2025-04-11 11:58:52

Hola! Mi nombre es Ilan Guerrero Rosario, tengo 19 años y soy de Puerto Rico. Actualmente estoy estudiando cine y teatro en New York y durante el último año también me he dedicado a escribir el guión para un cortometraje que me encantaría poder hacer realidad. Este corto llamado “BONCHE” explora temas como la amistad, la valentía, el amor, mezclado con suspenso, peleas épicas y todo envuelto con un toque boricua.

Para realizar un cortometraje o simplemente una producción cinematográfica se necesita atravesar diversos procesos retantes desde la preproducción hasta la post-producción. Todo esto cuesta; desde la paga de talentos, actores, bailarines, stunts, etc. hasta la renta de los distintos equipos de cine y luego la digitalización, colorización, todo lo que pertenece a la fase de edición. Además luego entrar a la fase de la distribución a festivales u otros foros de presentación. Todo esto suma a un presupuesto aproximado de veinte mil dólares ($20k). Al igual que los personajes del corto, me lleno de valentía y les pido que crean en mí, en mi visión y en el cine puertorriqueño.

Why “Resonance”?
In physics, resonance is when the frequency of an external vibration matches an object’s natural frequency, amplifying it. That’s what I want, for this vehicle, and for myself.

The film tackles self-worth, imposter syndrome, and body image through a plus-size protagonist in the music industry. It challenges the return of thinness in pop culture, while punk and drag serve as subversive art forms offering space for those told to shrink—physically, vocally, and emotionally.

Compiling these new arrangements into a body of work that the general public can listen to would be the perfect way to commemorate and celebrate the musical work we have put in and will continue to put in this year.

Right before I returned to school after thanksgiving break, I was able to visit him in the hospital to spend time with him. We shared a beautiful moment where we sat and watched college football together. In that moment, it didn’t feel like he was sick or that he was dying. It was just me and Grampy, watching football and chatting like nothing had changed. In the midst of all the chaos, everything was peaceful, and I got to just spend time with Grampy.

This was at least three years after the onset of symptoms. At first, FTD presents itself as random changes in one's behavior or personality.

Pump House Music Works, a dedicated 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, serves as a venue for music and related social events. We pride ourselves on delivering high-quality concerts across all genres and offering educational workshops to enrich our community’s musical traditions.

Over the past four years, the impact of the pandemic and our reliance on loans to stay afloat have led to significant financial challenges. As we move into the future, we face the possibility of closure after June unless we can overcome these hurdles.

As the owner, I want to express how vital your support is for us. Like many non-profits, we depend on generous donations to help us cover our operating costs. Running a small live music venue is incredibly challenging, but the rewards of bringing people together through music make it all worthwhile.

In the past, we have successfully navigated difficult periods through fundraisers and emergency grants. However, recent unexpected expenses have presented new obstacles. Following a successful Annual Fundraiser last November, which gave us hope for a stable winter, we encountered an unforeseen requirement for new liquor liability insurance that depleted our savings. This has put us in a precarious situation, and we now urgently need support.

In the heart of Auburn, an SEC campus in southern Alabama, eight college students came together, each with their desire to bring worship to Auburn University in a new way. First, this calling looked like holding a worship night at The Red Barn, an outdoor campus venue; thus, the name Red Barn Worship was born. On the day of the event, the radar predicted intense storms that would destroy the equipment that had been so graciously provided to us. Knowing our God's faithfulness, we continued to prepare because we had faith that the Lord was going to move in a way we did not expect. It rained and stormed up until the hour we had planned to begin setting up, but as soon as we began, the clouds parted in a circle above Red Barn. We watched the sunset and worshipped under the stars, leading hundreds of students in worship who attended. As soon as we left that night, the clouds closed, and the rain continued. We walked away knowing that the Lord’s plan for Red Barn Worship was going to be far more than any member of the band could fathom.",events-fundraiser,"Created March 27th, 2025",40,2025-04-11 12:05:47

*This fund raising is set privately and is only for students of Sri Chinmoy*

 I am Sevananda, a direct disciple of Mahagurudev Sri Chinmoy (1931-2007). Six years ago, in Varanasi and Rishikesh, I met a group of young Indian seekers eager for deep spiritual training.

Our journey began in Tapovan, Rishikesh, with up to 20 young men (ages 18-26) dedicated to a path of self-discovery and service. After two months of intense daily practice, we founded a Gurukulam (School of the Guru) on March 13, 2019. On that day, four of these young men became disciples of Sri Chinmoy. Since then, they have remained steadfast—soulful, devoted, and committed to living their Guru’s teachings.

 Our Sri Chinmoy-Peace-Service Gurukulam continues to grow, touching the lives of many. Incredibly, the families of these disciples were so inspired by their sons' transformation that they too have become disciples of Sri Chinmoy. But their journey has not been easy. These families are extremely poor, often struggling to afford even basic necessities. Many times, they go hungry—it breaks my heart to see their suffering.

 *How You Can Help*

 On March 13, we will celebrated the Gurukulam’s 6th anniversary and the 6th year anniversary of our 4 pioneer disciples. We hope to mark this occasion with a Joy Day—a pilgrimage to the Taj Mahal, Mathura, and Vrindavan, offering these young disciples a rare opportunity to experience India's sacred heritage. But beyond this celebration, we need your help to sustain and expand this sacred mission. Your generous support will provide food, essential supplies, and the resources needed to continue our service in Varanasi and Rishikesh. Please open your heart and become part of this special manifestation. Every contribution—no matter the amount—will make a tangible difference in the lives of these young seekers and their families.

Our current residence is under my ex husband’s name. In our divorce decree, finalized in 2021. I was given the right to refinance and a sum of family support to help maintain the family. Since June 2021 my ex has accrued over $55,000 in family support debt, has kept me from refinancing the loan in a timely manner, and has allowed the loan to end up in a default due to his decision-making. He requested a forbearance for the year of 2024 then did not complete the required review for modification to allow the loan to become up to date, this is because my ex decided he wants to sell the house, instead of allowing me to refinance.

We are writing to you on behalf of our wonderful sister-in-law, Alexa (Storch) Montenaro. Alexa is married to our brother Pete and they live in Oak Park, IL with their two children, Aurora (4.5) and Kai (2.5.) In late fall of 2024, Alexa started experiencing some concerning symptoms beginning with upper leg muscle weakness. Particularly in these first months of 2025, things have progressed significantly and she is experiencing decreased muscle strength in her legs, making many activities of her daily life very challenging. Stairs remain the biggest challenge, but even just flat walking has become difficult for fear of losing her balance and not having the strength to avoid falling, and she has stopped driving as well. Lifting her children up has been off the table for months, changing a dirty diaper is a struggle, making lunch for herself and the kids is draining, and even something as mundane as emptying the dishwasher takes a lot out of her. She has been going through the standard workup given her symptoms, including various blood work tests and multiple MRIs, etc., and she still doesn’t have an answer for what is causing this. Some of the potential remaining explanations for her symptoms are very serious and terrifying, and carrying that around has put an unimaginable emotional burden and stress on her that, without answers, will be a challenge in and of itself to shake and try to move beyond. There are so many people who love Alexa, and we are all doing what we can to help out including bringing meals, helping with the kids, and driving her and the kids where they need to be when Pete is unable to do so due to work commitments. However, there are many additional needs that we want to be sure Alexa can access WITHOUT having to worry about costs piling up. For example, if Alexa needs an Uber and a babysitter to get to one of her physical therapy appointments, or if Pete and Alexa are dog-tired by dinnertime and just want to order out. Additionally, we all want Alexa to do everything she can to support her healing which includes things like exploring functional medicine and acupuncture, which often aren't covered at all by insurance, but which have been proven effective in addressing these symptoms.",family-fundraiser,"Created March 10th, 2025",72,2025-04-11 12:32:46

He deeply loved his family and wanted to go and live back with them or visit them in different parts of the world. Sadly, he passed far too soon to visit his family, whom he hadn't seen in years. The reason for that is because George wanted to live alone and prove to everybody around him that he could do it! He did it! He genuinely supported himself and was a strong man. For him, living alone starting at 16 years old is incredibly admirable, and I would like everybody to acknowledge that. He worked as a manager for one of the biggest yoshinoyas in LA. He wanted and persued his dream of being a musician and guitar player by uploading videos of him playing and creating songs. He tried learning and working as an electrician through the union. All of that while living alone and supporting himself. But him being alone made him suffer a lot of depression and loneliness, but he was always trying to make everyone around him not worry and be happy.

My little brother Tobias started his freshman year at Gertz-Ressler High School and he decided to join the swim team. After 5 years of Gertz not having a swim team, this year they are finally back- with 32 swimmers on the team! I went to their first swim meet and the weather was not the best. It was windy, cold, and rainy. I noticed that most students only had towels and not parkas. A parka is what swimmers use to keep warm in between their swim relays. By the time they were half done most swimmers were shivering because their towels were wet and they were cold.

My brother is fortunate enough to have two sisters who are able to help him out financially if he needs an expensive item like a parka. It is understandable that families are unable to purchase such an expensive item for their swimmer. Therefore, it is my hope that we can come together as a community to raise money to purchase customized parkas for the entire swim team.",sports-fundraiser,Created 3 d ago,12,2025-04-11 12:37:06

That’s when I found DARFIGHT—a gym that became my second home and second family.

We want to improve Aldarra with a well, irrigation for field watering, improved parking, entrance renovation, snack shack remodel, covered batting cages with lights, new tools for maintenance, and a playset for the little up-and-coming players. We would love for these fields to be a place for the community of all ages, and a safe place for all kids to embrace the power of camaraderie and competition. Please share, donate, and help our non-profit make a place for the future of our kids in the Snoqualmie Valley. We would happily accept donations in kind to help us reach these goals if any companies can help with electrical, materials, or construction.",sports-fundraiser,Created 4 d ago,9,2025-04-11 12:41:57

Studying abroad in South Korea this summer would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me—one that represents not just personal growth, but a way to make my family proud as well. As a first-generation college student from an immigrant background, I’ve grown up watching my parents work incredibly hard to give me a future filled with opportunities they never had. They’ve always encouraged me to dream big, even when their own dreams had to be put on hold. Being able to study abroad would be a way for me to honor their sacrifices and show them that everything they’ve done for me has a lasting impact.

My name is Ms. Rosen and I am currently one of your child’s educators. We have all heard the stories now about education, students and the effects of COVID, but it wasn't until 2022 when I had my freshman AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) class walk in that I truly understood for myself. I had been teaching for 17 years, teaching AVID for 16 of those years and I had never encountered a class like this. Not unlike my other AVID classes they each have a story, they each are a beautiful human beings, and to they have personality is an understatement. But to put all these delightful personalities in one space with new ways of learning that I sure didn't know about, well, it was a bit rocky. There were moments of triumph and failure, but with each year we have grown, we have learned, and we have become the family we were meant to be. This struggle to get here brought us closer together and has pushed us to try new things, go on new field trips, and work with our unified program to be a team in our classroom and in the community. This has helped lead to our new and last final adventure. Before the last year has come and gone and it is time for our family to move on to their own individual journeys, there is one last new adventure we are determined to take. We would like to be the first AVID class from our school to go on an HBCU Virginia based college tour. Our goal is to see Virginia State University, Virginia Union University, Hampton University, and Norfolk State University, as well as, some sight seeing in the area. A majority of students have not been out of the state, so this experience is bigger than a college visit, but it is also a life experience. For some the experience of an HBCU as an option could be a reality that they had not known before, this is the trip to help them find out. But this trip is not just a chance to make life long memories, to experience college life, but it is to be able to immerse themselves, in a meaningful way, in their future, whatever that might entail. However, the downside to this experience is the cost, the reason that so many have not gone out of state is because they have not had the funding to do so. We have only ever be able to do in-state college tours, so this could set up, and expand what we will be able to offer students now and in the future. That is where we graciously ask for any and all support you are willing to give us. We cannot do this alone and hope that you can help support the wonderful benefits of this amazing opportunity.",travel-fundraiser,Created 5 d ago,12,2025-04-11 12:44:51

I've spoken with the doctors, and they need me to come to California. Her mental and physical state aren't good. Unfortunately, due to the fact that my mother is in a facility in Nashville where she choked on March 3 and then went into cardiac arrest, I financially just cannot afford to go to California, especially with the three children. If there is any way that anyone could help so I can go to California to see her and hold my baby to assure her WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND GOD IS ON HER SIDE, I will need financial help to take care of the bills and things for her for a while. I'm going to be with her as much as I can. I'll have to fly back and forth due to the fact I still have the children. The plan will be to relocate her back to the Tennessee burn unit once she's stable enough. She has a very long recovery ahead of her. I was told I will need to fly back and forth. I'm not sure for how much longer before she can be transferred. She's already had 3 surgeries and many more to come before physical therapy. I understand times are hard for everyone, but if there is any way you could help at all, it's very deeply appreciated. Lots of prayers are needed and thank you so much in advance.

Hi! My name is Naphtali, and I’m a high school student working toward my Eagle Scout rank. For my project, I’m leading an effort to plant new trees in The Willows, a local park in Radnor.

These are the most expensive months of the year for our rescue. We rescue and rehabilitate orphaned and injured hawks, owls, eagles, falcons, vultures and also hummingbirds. Raptor Tales Rescue is a Veteran-run volunteer wildlife rehabilitation facility located in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. While our many long-term adult raptors are supported, we have been slammed with intakes and are late to begin fundraising for baby season 2025. Often times it is not just one young raptor being found; it can be 3 or 4 at once! Caring for babies costs us a small fortune in mice, rats, chicks and quail as each one will eat 3-4 times more than an adult daily!
Another part of baby season is the long process of renesting/reuniting young birds with their parents. This is costly with transport to original location where found (anywhere in the state), often multiple times, to ensure parents are returning, using trail cameras (we may need to purchase more depending on how many are in use per baby), and purchasing nest boxes/artificial nests when homes are destroyed by the weather or by tree removal. This is an EXTREMELY time-consuming process that takes our rescue many hours over several days or up to a week to complete (per young bird!). We are thankful for our volunteers that assist us!

Musicians, who come to play and entertain our elderly deserve better. We want our residents and visitors such as our mom , to have a piano to play and sing for each other; to share the love of music that sounds beautiful.
Nursing homes need to be filled with music for our residents. Music is something none of us can do without, especially at the end of our lives.
